      <li>There is nothing that we can do for someone who doesn't appreciate whats in front of them.</li>
      <li>My heart was pounding the whole time.It was the most erotic moment of my life.Up until then,at least.
        If every unfolding we experience takes us further along in life,then,we are truly experiencing what life is offering.
        The most affectionate love I imagined is that I live as you used to be after you have gone away.
        The more difficult something is the more rewarding it is in the end.
        Here comes a point when a reasonable men will swallow his pride and admit that he is made a terrible mistake.
        The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for circumstances they want,and if they cannot find them,make them.
        If you wish to succeed,you should use persistence as your good friend,experience as your reference,prudence as your brother and hope as your sentry.
        I love and am used to keeping a distance with those changed things.Only in this way can I know what will not be abandoned by time.
        An unacceptable love needs no sorrow but time- some time for forgetting.A badly-hurt heart needs no sympathy but understanding.
        When you finally get your own happiness,you will understanding the previous sadness is a kind of treasure,which makes you better to hold and cherish the people you love.
